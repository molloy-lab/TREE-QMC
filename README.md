TREE-QMC
========

[![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/tree-qmc/README.html)

TREE-QMC is a quartet-based method for estimating species trees directly from gene trees or characters, like the popular methods [ASTRAL](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2129-y) and [Weighted ASTRAL/ASTER](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac215). However, TREE-QMC uses a different algorithmic approach than ASTRAL/ASTER, based on the Quartet Max Cut (QMC) framework of Snir and Rao.

To learn more about the TREE-QMC and weighted TREE-QMC, check out [Han & Molloy, *Genome Res*, 2023](http:doi.org/10.1101/gr.277629.122) and [Han & Molloy, *Systematic Biology*, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaf009), respectively. 

TREE-QMC also implements some convenient features:
+ TREE-QMC allows multi-labeled trees (i.e., MUL-trees) as input.
+ TREE-QMC allows character data as input; in particular, it can be used to estimate species trees under the neutral Wright-Fisher model with MLE branch lengths, referred to as `bp` mode in [Springer et al., *J Heredity*, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esz076) and [Molloy, Gatesy & Springer, *Syst Biol*, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab086). Although species trees can also be constructed from multi-state characters we do not make guarantees about performance.
+ TREE-QMC computes **Partitioned Coalescence Support (PCS)**, specifically Quartet Quadrapartition Support (QQS) values, around a focal branch, as described by [Gatesy et al., *Mol Phy Evol*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106539).

TREE-QMC is based on the Quartet Max Cut (QMC) framework introduced by Sagi Snir and Satish Rao; see [Snir & Rao, *IEEE/ACM TCBB*, 2010](http:doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2008.133) and [Avni, Cohen & Snir, *Syst Biol*, 2015](http:doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syu087). TREE-QMC contributes fast algorithms for constructing the quartet graph directly from the input trees, rather than explicitly enumerating all quartets or sampling quartets.

TREE-QMC now implements efficient (and brute force) algorithms for the **quartet weighting schemes** introduced by Chao Zhang and Siavash Mirarab; see [Zhang & Mirarab, *Mol Biol Evol*, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac215). It also implements quartet support with the approach of [Sayyari & Mirarab, *Mol Biol Evol*, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw079).

TREE-QMC uses [MQLib](https://github.com/MQLib/MQLib) for its max cut heuristic; see [Dunning, Gupta, & Silberholz, *INFORMS Journal on Computing*, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0798).

TREE-QMC uses [toms743](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/toms743/toms743.html) for its Lambert's W approximation; see [Fritsch, Shafer & Crowley, *Communications of the ACM*, 1973](https://doi.org/10.1145/361952.361970) and [Barry, Barry & Culligan-Hensley, *ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software*, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1145/203082.203088).

Build
-----
To build TREE-QMC, use commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/molloy-lab/TREE-QMC.git
cd TREE-QMC/external/MQLib
make
cd ../..
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 \
    -I external/MQLib/include -I external/toms743 \
    -o tree-qmc \
    src/*.cpp external/toms743/toms743.cpp \
    external/MQLib/bin/MQLib.a -lm \
    -DVERSION=\"$(cat version.txt)\"
```

Usage
-----
To run TREE-QMC, use command:
```
./tree-qmc -i <input file>
```


Tips
----

#1. For convenience, add the directory containing the `tree-qmc` binary to your `PATH` variable so that you can type `tree-qmc` instead of `<path to tree-qmc binary>tree-qmc`. For bash, this can be done by adding
```
export PATH=$PATH:"path to tree-qmc binary"
```
to `~/.bash_profile` file (or `~/.bashrc` file).

#2. If you are having strange problems, try removing the `\r` characters from the input files and trying again:
```
cat file.txt | tr -d '\r' > newfile.txt
```

Options
-------

To see the TREE-QMC usage options, use command:
```
./tree-qmc -h
